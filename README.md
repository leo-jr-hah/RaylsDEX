# 🌉 Rayls DEX Vision — Hybrid Exchange Mock

A conceptual prototype inspired by the Rayls blockchain ecosystem — designed to visualize how a hybrid DEX could bridge institutional liquidity and decentralized finance (DeFi).

This project demonstrates the "Two Floors, One DEX" idea — a public and private trading layer seamlessly connected by Rayls' architecture.

## Concept Overview

### 🔹 Rayls public chain

- Open to verified users and DeFi protocols.
- Transparent order books, open liquidity, and composability.
- Ideal for retail traders and public DeFi pools.
- Example tokens: USDC, ETH, RLS, BTC

### 🔹 Rayls Private chain

- For institutions requiring privacy and compliance.
- Uses auditable privacy tech (inspired by Enygma protocol).
- Private order matching, invisible to other users, but auditable by regulators.
- Example assets: Tokenized Bonds, Treasury Bills, Corporate Deposits

These two layers coexist, enabling real-world asset liquidity while maintaining compliance.

## Vision

Traditional DEXs make users choose between transparency and privacy.  
The Rayls DEX Vision merges both:

> Transparency for users. Privacy for institutions. Liquidity for everyone.

Institutions trade privately.
Retail users access institutional-grade liquidity.
Compliance is built-in — not an afterthought.
